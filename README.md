- 👋 Hey, I’m @Rythorian77. I'm an experimental software engineer. I am an Ethical Hacker. In recent times, I 
 diverted my focus on other projects regarding AI development, & attacking corporations who destroy our earth. We are many...we are anonymous & we are waiting.
- 👀 I’m interested in all sorts of computer language, especially c# and yes, VB.NET. I have my reasons for VB.NET, mainly because it's quite powerful for particular tasks.
It may be dead to Microsoft, but not me nor the private development I have added to it.
- 🌱 I’m currently working with deep learning for AI
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing. My work is private.
- 📫 I am a ghost and this is the only place you'll find me. If I want to find you, I will. I am looking for gifted people who think outside the box. Most tend to loop
around the same mistakes. I do not.
