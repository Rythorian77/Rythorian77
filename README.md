- 👋 Hey, I’m Justin. I'm an experimental software engineer & a retired Ethical Hacker. In recent times, I 
 diverted my focus on other projects regarding AI development, & Malware/Ransom-Ware behaviour, which is strictly for educational research only.
- 👀 I’m interested in all sorts of computer language, especially c#, Batch and yes, VB.NET. I have my reasons for VB.NET, mainly because it's quite powerful for particular tasks. Microsoft couldn't meet the demand to keep VB.Net going because they are failures, so I am picking up their work and developing hybrid techniques.
It may be dead to Microsoft, but not me nor the private development I have added to it.
- 🌱 I’m currently working with deep learning, Malware and Ransomware behavior, Web Site Design using HTML, CSS & JavaScript. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing. My work is private and sometimes I give programs/code freely to the public.
- 📫 I am a ghost and this is the only place you'll find me or:
- Youtube at: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKIZrCrSyW_db1ZFCE5-MZw/videos?view=0&sort=dd&shelf_id=0. 
- If I want to find you, I will. I am looking for gifted people who think outside the box. Most tend to loop around the same mistakes. I do not.
